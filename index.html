            <h3>Japan, land of the rising sun</h3>
            <p>
              Japan is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered
              on the west by the Sea of Japan and by the Philippine sea in the
              south. Japan is called the "land of the rising sun" because in the
              beginning of the 13th century, a group of sailors who met Marco
              Polo in China told him about a land that existed in 'the sun's
              origin' or where the sun rises. The Japanese word 'Nippon' means
              Sun origin.
              <br />
              <br />
              Japan is a beautiful country with a fascinating history that dates
              back thousands of years. There are many temples and shrines
              throughout Japan that showcase this rich history. Japan's
              landscape is mountainous as large cities are concentrated along
              the coastlines. Japan is divided into 47 administrative
              prefectures and eight traditional regions. The capital city,
              Tokyo, is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Jessica Boll and I'm from Milwaukee, WI USA. I love
              learning about different cultures and would love to someday travel
              to Japan. The beautiful rural mountain villages to urbanscapes
              such as Tokyo has me intrigued.
